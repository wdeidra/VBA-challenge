# VBA-challenge
Module 2 Challenge
I had a tutoring session with CJ and he took me through the process of this homework assignment. We didn't get to finish but I began to understand the looping process. Time evenutually ran out and as I ran the program, it only changed a few rows. I knew I needed more practice so I purchased Excel VBS in easy steps by Mike McGrath and I also looked at the Zoom sessions from my previous class. I honestly ended up using a code (verbatim) from Chegg.com because it was taking me weeks to turn in this assignment and there were many steps that I was missing in order for it to run properly. 
I have also attached the code in which CJ and I worked on for this assignment.
